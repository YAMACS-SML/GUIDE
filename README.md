# GUIDE
Yasara Plugin for QM calculations

GUIDE is a plugin that enables users to perform ORCA and MOPAC Quantum Mechanical (QM) calculations through YASARA, providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for running calculations typically performed via a command-line interface.
To install, download the Python script (GUIDE_YASARA_structure.py/GUIDE_YASARA_view.py). If you use the YASARA structure suite, download the "GUIDE_YASARA_structure.py" file. Unlike the YASARA view (free version), the YASARA structure suite has some extra features like Energy minimization, Charge calculation, Fixing of atoms etc., allowing several advanced-level QM calculations using GUIDE. For free YASARA view suite, download the "GUIDE_YASARA_view.py" file. The file must be placed in the plg folder inside YASARA installation path. Check User Manual and installation video for further information and instructions.
